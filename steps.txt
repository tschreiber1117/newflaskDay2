Here are the steps I've taken so far:

1. Created my file structure
2. Create my virtual environments - virtual environments are now a standard part of python
    python -m venv <name of my new environment>
3. Activate my virtual environment (run the executable activate)
    pc: venv\scripts\activate
    mac/linux: source venv/bin/activate
4. I can install flask!
    All of our packages are gonna be installed thru pip -> so once we're inside our virtual environment, we can use pip commands

    pip install flask

5. Every project should have a requirements.txt file -> this file shows other developers what packages this project requires to work
    to initially make and/or update your requirements.txt file
        pip freeze > requirements.txt
    
    if you cloned a project with a requirements.txt file, you can run
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    which will go through and install all the packages listed in requirements.txt

6. Add our configuration setup so that the app knows how to run
    Three files control the setup of our application: config.py (and by extension the .env file), __init__.py, and run.py

    Set up variables in config.py
        matching variables as needed in .env
    
    Set up __init__.py file



#### Database stuff below Here
# Database packages: SQLalchemy, flask-migrate, psycopg2 (pyscopg2-binary for mac/linux)
# Might also need some python modules depending on what you want in your database: commonly used - datetime, uuid

# Set DATABASE_URL in .env file and link in config
# initialize, migrate, and upgrade our database to match our models
    # flask db init
    # flask db migrate
    # flask db upgrade
